# Contributing
 
If you're interested in contributing to the Rokucraft Wiki, please read the following guidelines:
 
## Contexts

### I have a question!
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MF3u9xZ), as that is where you will receive support for everything [Rokucraft](https://www.rokucraft.com)!
 
### I've found a bug!
If you notice a bug in our source code or within the wiki pages you are more than welcome to [submit an issue in this repository](https://github.com/Rokucraft/RokuWiki/issues/new/choose). You can also create pull requests with the fixes you've made yourself.
 
### I want to see a feature added!
Have a possible feature in mind that you think will improve the wiki? Awesome! You can [submit an issue](https://github.com/Rokucraft/RokuWiki/issues/new/choose) for it in this repository and maybe it will get added one day! If you want, you can also submit a pull request in which you add these features. For major changes however, we ask that you always open an issue first to describe your feature proposal. This allows us to collaborate more effectively and prevent duplicate work.
 
## Guidelines
 
### Submitting Issues
When submitting an issue it's important we make the process as fluid as possible from our end to yours and vice versa. We ask that before you submit an issue, you check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Rokucraft/RokuWiki/issues) first. This is to prevent duplicate issues, so that we can spend our time as efficiently as possible. You might also learn a lot from reading discussions within open and closed issues!
 
A key step in fixing bugs is being able to reproduce the bug in question. For us to be able to do this, we need specific questions to be answered. These will be asked through our issue templates, meaning it's important for you to follow these templates and answer all the questions, providing clear descriptions and context when necessary.
 
### Submitting Pull Requests
Similarly to submitting issues, we ask that you search the repository's closed and open pull requests so that no one ends up doing additional work. If you find that there are no related pull requests, go ahead and submit one.

Please commit your changes on a different git branch, and write descriptive commit messages. Before submitting a pull request, we ask that you test your changes if these are more than simple text edits. Instructions on how to build the wiki can be found [here](README.md#building). When you are ready to PR, select `RokuWiki:main` as the base branch, write a nice description of your changes and submit it.
