## Waterbending

    <font size=3> “Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribes are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.”</font>
    
As a waterbender you have fairly strong defensive and offensive attacks. You will be able to form shields in different ways as well as harm your opponent through different kinds of water and ice moves.

Water’s biggest weakness is it’s lack of mobility. Thankfully, this is compensated by the good defence that waterbending has to offer.

If waterbenders are near a water source, they will be able to use all kinds of utility moves. Whether this is an air bubble to keep you from drowning, or to allow you to swim faster than benders from other elements.

## Earthbending

    <font size=3> “Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring.”</font>
    
The key to being an Earthbender is to wait and listen for the right moment to strike. When the moment comes, you must act decisively. On the server, you have a lot of tactical moves. They could trick, trap, or blind your opponent. This can be especially effective when combined with other moves.

Earthbending has both a good defence and a good variety of offensive moves. As an earthbender you are able to catapult yourself in the air or move yourself around, as long as you are surrounded by earth.

Although earth has decent mobility, offence and defence, you are often required to stand on earth to be able to perform the move. Earth is also somewhat slow and not very dynamic.

## Firebending

    <font size=3> “Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want.”</font>
    
Firebending on the server is just like in the show; the element is known for its intense and powerful attacks. You will have the biggest arsenal of offensive moves that are meant to harm your opponent. You will have the most variety in attacks as a Firebender. But watch out! Firebending can also be harmful to you, if you are not careful enough.

Fire’s biggest weakness is its lack of defensive moves.

As a firebender, you are able to propel yourself in the air, or just on the ground. You will also have a few moves that are meant for mobility for in or or outside of combat.

## Airbending

    <font size=3> “Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom.”</font>
    
Airbending is known for its dynamic and wide variation of mobility. On the server, you will find a lot of moves that involve mobility. This ranges from just jumping super high up, to the famous Airscooter.

The effectiveness of an Airbender’s defence relies on mobility. An Airbender will mostly use their mobility to avoid incoming attacks from opponents.

As an Airbender, you will have less choice when it comes to offensive moves. Harmful moves will be limited, but still fair enough to defeat an opponent.
