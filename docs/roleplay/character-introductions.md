# Character Introductions

You might be wondering what people mean when they talk about character introductions. A character introduction is a page where you explain who your character is for other people in the community to see. These can be very useful for people who want to learn your character;s backstory, strengths, traits, etc. without having to go around asking you for every specific detail. You can see other people;s character introductions and make your own in our 'Character Introductions' section on our <a href="https://www.rokucraft.com/forum/m/24336306/viewforum/9027575" target="_blank">forums</a>.
