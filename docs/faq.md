## Gameplay

??? question "How do I connect to the server?"
    You can connect to our Minecraft server by adding it to your server list. Our IP address is `play.rokucraft.com` and the current version of the server is **1.16.5**.

    Note that you can only join our server using a valid copy of Minecraft Java Edition. Cracked versions of Minecraft are not able to join our server and never will be.

??? question "How do I travel around the server?"
    The captains and bison rider in Harbor Town will happily take you to many places in their nations! Simply click one to see the locations they have available. You'll often find Coachmen too, who can take you other places on the mainland.

??? question "How do I get food?"
    You can purchase food from stalls or find it in treasure chests throughout the world.

??? question "How do I get an Air Glider?"
    You can buy a glider for Â¥2500 at any of the Air Temples. Other villages, such as Gaoling, might have a glider shop too. ðŸ˜‰
    
    Gliders aren't limited to only airbenders either, anyone can get one!

??? question "I'm stuck, what do I do?"
    If you're stuck and cannot move, you're can always use `/spawn` to teleport back to Harbor Town. We also ask that you tell a staff member where you got stuck to prevent it from happening again in the future. ðŸ˜„

??? question "Why are some bending moves blocked in certain places?"
    You're not able to PVP in some locations such as towns, mines, minigames, etc. Your moves won't be able to damage other players, and some moves are even blocked entirely because of it. You'll be able to use all your moves out in the wilds or in dueling arenas though!

??? question "How do I change my bending element?"
    You are only able to bend one element at a time. If you wish to change your bending element, you can contact a staff member. They will assist you throughout the process. Keep in mind you can only change **once every 2 months**, and you will **lose all your bending progress and arena statistics**.

## Money
