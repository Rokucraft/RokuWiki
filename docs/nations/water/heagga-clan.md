# The Heagga of Nauruk

## Basic Information

The Heagga clan is rooted in the old capital, also known as Nauruk. They are the most spiritual out of all clans and have the most Shamans and healers. They used to be the Capital of the Southern Water Tribe but that has not been the case for many years. Due to their proximity to the closed spirit portal, the clan's environment is the most suitable for growing herbs and other flora in the Southern Tribe.

### Social Norms
Nauruk/Heagga clan is rather conservative and traditional. But unlike most, if not all clans the females are higher up. They are the head of the households and the men are deemed to be inferior. Outside the houses men usually live freely and do more for fun than work unlike the women do. When a woman and man marry they move into the females family home and carry the females name. And not the males.

### Reindeer Herding

When they are able to, the people of the Heagga often herd the reindeer in their surrounding lands.

### Attire
Unlike the other clan’s furs and mostly blue attire, the Heagga clan looks very different. Due to their spirituality and heavy belief in spirits, they have slowly developed their own very distinctive style. They call their ceremonial robes and clothing Gakti. They have red threads and patterns sewn into them and often have gold accessories. The shapes vary between people. Married and single people have different patterns, shamans and others have different patterns, chieftains have different patterns and the list goes on.

The colours in gakti are blue, yellow, red, brown and green usually. People of Heagga do not wear makeup or warpaint, other than the 14-year-old boy’s paint after they have passed their rite for manhood. Just like clothing, hair is also important. After being colonised by the Fire nation for many years, they adopted many aspects of Fire Nation culture. You can tell by a person's hair, clothing and accessories what rank or profession they hold in the Clan.

## Rituals

### Duodji
It is a sacred special craft made in ritualistic means to make knives, gakti, beds etc. Men use wood of a sacred tree that is only chopped down for this ritual. Bones and antlers are used as well. The men have to raise a Yak and then offer it to the spirits. Only then they can use these items. Unlike the men, women use leather and roots to make clothing and other tools.

### Yoiking
Yoik is the special ritualistic way of singing in the Heagga clan. It is a hymn-like way of singing. Shamans often yoik while performing rituals. For every ritual there is a different style of Yoik. The people also sing Yoik’s when big feasts are held or just as a every day activity.

### Passing/Birthing

When someone passes away the clan comes together. The shamans chant a Yoik while the Chieftain prepares the body to go from the human world to the Spirit world.

When a baby is born they bring it to the Elder Shaman's igloo. They hand him or her over while the Elders perform a ritual. Once they are done blessing the child with their gifts they hand them back to the parents.

### Military

Due to them being the old capital they have a bigger military station than most. But now that they aren’t it has reduced and have now less military men and women. The heagga clan does provide most healers for the army. Even though the military is one, the Heagga warriors wear signs of their tribe to show respect to the spirits.

### Fighting Style

The warriors of Nauruk/Heagga do not believe in taking ones life without reason, they will try to be more on the defensive side rather than offensive. Though when hunting they will try to take the animal's life swiftly and painlessly, ending with a thanking ritual.

### Healing

Healers and shamans make up most of the population. They have some of the best healers.

## Transport & Trade

### Transport
They use a lot of Reindeer Yak’s: riding on them, making them pull sleds etc. On seas they use ships either made from their wood, or just a boat that the entire tribe uses.

### Trade
Because they have the most flora, the Heagga provides most of the tribes medicinal herbs. They also provide wood and other substances such as Yaks.
