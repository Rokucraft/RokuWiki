## Main Rules
1. **Be respectful at all times**  
Please treat others the way that you would like to be treated. We are accepting of individuals from all backgrounds and cultures, and absolutely no harassment, discrimination, or hate speech will be tolerated.  
If you wish to provide feedback, please do so in a constructive manner.

2. **Refrain from inappropriate behaviour**  
This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Threats
    - Trolling
    - Scamming
    - Spreading false information
    - Sharing inappropriate content
    - Randomly attacking players in-game

3. **No negativity**  
We do not tolerate any form of negativity. Initiating or engaging in drama and arguments is therefore not allowed.

4. **Do not swear excessively or maliciously**  
Light swearing is allowed, as long as it is not excessive or offensive. We ask that you be mindful of the younger members in our community.

5. **Keep away from sensitive topics**  
This includes controversial, political or religious subjects, which can lead to heated arguments. Furthermore, please do not discuss topics which may make others feel uncomfortable.

6. **No inappropriate usernames, profile pictures, statuses or skins**  
If caught with any of the above, you will be asked to change it to something more appropriate.

7. **English only**  
We are only able to moderate effectively when everyone speaks the same language. Please refrain from speaking other languages in public spaces.

8. **No spamming**  
Do not spam characters or messages in any chats.

9. **No advertising**  
Do not advertise any other servers or associations. Advertising to other server members in direct messages is also strictly prohibited.

10. **No cheating or exploiting**  
We promote a fair and positive environment, enjoyable for all players. Anything that gives you an unfair advantage over others is considered cheating. This rule encompasses the following:
    - Using mods other than OptiFine
    - Using hacked clients
    - X-Ray
    - Glitch exploitation - If you find a glitch, please report it to staff!

11. **Do not evade bans or other punishments**  
If banned, please make an appeal on the website; our moderation team will then assess your situation. Ban or punishment evasion will result in an immediate permanent ban without a chance of appeal.

12. **Do not steal any of Rokucraft’s content**  
Stealing our maps, builds, models or other content is not permitted.

13. **No chargebacks**  
We do not offer refunds. Chargebacks will result in an immediate ban. If you wish to change your nickname, you will need to purchase a new one.

14. **Do not impersonate staff**  
Staff impersonation on any level is forbidden. The use of similar names or skins is also prohibited.

15. **Respect decisions made by staff**  
Staff attempt to promote and maintain a positive environment on Rokucraft. If you feel that a staff member’s decision is unfair, please contact a Team Leader or Admin regarding the situation.

## Housing & Shop Rules

1. **Do not exceed the following limits:**  
    - **Your main account can have two houses and two shops**
    - **Your alternate accounts can only have one house and one shop**  
      Please note that ships and air bison are considered ‘houses’.
    - **Houses and shops can have up to 30 entities, whereas estates can have up to 50**  
      Entities include item frames and paintings. These limits exist to prevent lag that may affect yourself and others.

2. **Do not alter the exterior of your buildings**  
You are free to change and decorate the interior of your house or shop. However, do not make significant changes to the exterior of the building. This is to maintain the intended atmosphere and look of the town or city. You may only make minor changes, such as placing flowers, pots or banners.

3. **Do not turn your house into a shop or vice versa**
